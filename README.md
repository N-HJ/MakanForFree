MakanForFree is an app catered to the HCI student population which aims to reduce the amount of food waste produced by buffets on HCI school grounds. Currently, plenty of food goes to waste as event organisers tend to order extra food to prevent a situation in which there is too little food for event participants. This results in a surplus of food which is often thrown away when the buffet expires. We thus intend to cut the amount of food waste generated by such buffets by inviting students to finish up the leftover food in the buffet after it has ended.
