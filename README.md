MakanForFree is an app catered to the HCI student population which aims to reduce the amount of food waste produced by buffets on HCI school grounds. Currently, plenty of food goes to waste as event organisers tend to order extra food to prevent a situation in which there is too little food for event participants. This results in a surplus of food which is often thrown away when the buffet expires. We thus intend to cut the amount of food waste generated by such buffets by inviting students to finish up the leftover food in the buffet after it has ended.

MakanForFree is supported on both iOS and Android, but unfortunately has not found its way to the App Store or Play Store due to various challenges. MakanForFree was coded with Dart (Flutter), and Cloud Firestore was the chosen backend database. The Firebase Authentication SDK was also utilised in the application.
